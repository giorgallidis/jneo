## Are we inherently evil?

![Evil](../../images/evil.jpg)

A simple question to understand the nature of humanity yet a very consequential one. This may seem like a throwback to the Original Sin, but in an era where we are looking to maximize human lifespan and our footprint on Earth and across our solar system, it's a question worth asking. To come down unequivocally on one side of this debate might seem rather naïve, the mark of someone who has failed to grasp the messy reality of the human condition; that we are complex creatures capable of both good and evil. But it is very clear that our judgements about the societies in which we live are greatly shaped by underlying visions of human nature and the political possibilities that these visions entail. And these judgements define humanity's pursuits in ways that could hinder our ability to evolve fast enough to salvage our species. 

Historically speaking, the notion of evil is a societal mainstay. In cultures with Manichaean and Abrahamic religious influence, evil is usually perceived as the dualistic antagonistic opposite of good, in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated.[1] In cultures with Buddhist spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving emptiness in the sense of recognition of good and evil being two opposing principles but not a reality, emptying the duality of them, and achieving a oneness.[1]

Over time, the theologically derived definitions of good and evil have been transposed to political derived ones - perhaps as a result of centuries of intermixing between the two. In past centuries, good and evil may have been defined as rules/knowledge presented to humans courtesy of a deity. In recent times, good and evil are defined through the interpretation of voted on laws which themselves are derived from social norms (after all they are the result of the majority vote) and enforced by appointed officials with varying degrees of personal interpretation. 

Assessing the nature of one as 'evil' however is highly subjective. Are we naturally self-interested and look out for ourselves first and foremost or are we self-interested and competitive now because of the way that modern societies have developed. We care about our reputation, as well as our material wellbeing, and our desire for social standing drives us into conflict as much as competition over scarce resources. Do we assess another's 'evil' nature according to our own (or the majority's) interest and views of the world? Even if so, is that a good or bad thing? If the majority is happy and thriving, why allow the self-interest of an individual or a minority to impact the majority? Today maybe you're part of the majority or at least (a) majority that matters today. At some point you will be in the minority, and in that moment, what will you think is good or evil? 

Evil itself as a word is not without variance in its definition:
In the Old Testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to God as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the fallen angels Satan.
In the Merriam Webster dictionary, Evil is defined as the quality of being morally reprehensibly or causing harm or misfortune. An example of an evil is discrimination or an evil impulse. 

It seems as if good and evil are generally a byproduct of two key variables:
(1) The ruling majority
(2) Those in positions of power (thought leadership included)
(3) (situational) The rising minority

Perhaps the question isn't really about whether we are good or evil but whether how can we co-exist in the presence of such variability in what drives our idea of right and wrong. The issue perhaps resides in the notion that evil and good even exist which itself is derived from religious origins. Evil, in a general context, is the absence or opposite of that which is described as being good. So, by definition, in order to define what is evil, we would first need to define what is good. And how is that possible?

If we are able to successfully create technology that extends human lifespan and takes us across the solar system, will that technology be used morally? And who will define what that morality is? The majority appointed leader? The wealthy majority? The class majority? 

Perhaps, in the future, societies will not be devised based on nationality or location but based on genetic similarity. Perhaps, we will find a way to create a more uniform consistency of belief or respect or find a way to co-habitate despite our morally different ideologies. 

These are questions that place an enormous burden on any of us engaged in advancing the human species. While we advance the abilities of the human species, we must also ensure that we are advancing these technologies for all humans equally and fairly.
