#Longevity Known Variables

The below assumptions are all based on the idea that you manage to avoid serious injury/death from an accident (According to the CDC 'accidents' [rank #3](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) in the leading causes of death). It also assumes you avoid infectious disease, suicide and homicide ('[#8](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm)', '#[10](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm)' and '[outside top 10](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm)' in same ranking). Those factors put together account for ~10% of deaths in the U.S.* Also to some non-trivial effect, following the right longevity interventions, your risk of death from accidents, infectious disease and suicide should be reduced.

** This varies greatly country to country and somewhat even within different populations in the United States.*

# TL;DR

The exact mechanisms of longevity still largely remain a mystery but predominantly model species studies and some human studies have provided some clues. They suggest that maintaining good nutrition, following dietary restriction, getting adequate exercise & sleep, maintaining a healthy microbiome and consuming specific nutraceuticals can have a direct impact on the secondary longevity variables (i.e. disease). The role of genetics and epigenetics is relevant beyond just observing inevitable outcomes including pharmaceutical & medical procedure interventions.  

Importantly, studies have shown that more years alive is not necessarily associated with late-life disability and disease - a common objection of longevity driven intervention opponents. 

In addition, the role of aesthetics in longevity plays a part in the ability of individuals to pursue further adherence to the right steps to longevity. Lastly, interventions on aging related (i.e. non neurological or injury related) cognitive impairment plays a role in not just quality of life at old age but also to peak lifespan.

## Key ideas:

1. **Dietary Restriction** 

Caloric restriction(CR) without malnutrition is considered to be one of the most effective
non-pharmacological intervention that enhances longevity and healthspan in numerous nonhuman species. Dietary restriction (DR), implemented as chronic and coordinate reduced intake of all dietary constituents except vitamins and minerals, was first shown 80 years ago to extend lifespan in rats. DR started in young, adult Rhesus monkeys greatly improves metabolic health; prevents obesity; delays the onset of sarcopenia, loss of hearing, and brain atrophy; and reduces the risk of developing and dying of type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. In humans, severe food restriction without malnutrition results in many of the same physiological, metabolic, and molecular changes associated with DR in animals, including less age-associated myocardial stiffness and autonomic dysfunction, lower core body temperature, and downregulation of the pi3k/akt/ foxo and inflammatory pathways in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, humans voluntarily undertaking long-term DR score lower than controls on multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer. In short-term, randomized clinical trials in aging humans, DR improves several markers of health.

2. **Exercise & Mobility**

Exercise at moderate intensity that results in ~3,000 calories of activity per week (or approximately 7 hours) tends to promote the biggest cardio, insulin and overall health response. Extreme training has a similar effect to the cardiovascular system as an unhealthy diet (i.e. negative). Maintaining joint & bone health is important towards longevity outcomes as these can lead to (among other things) mobility limitations that impact ability to get adequate exercise, inflammation issues that impact cellular energy and the need for pain medications which themselves are contra-indicated for longevity. Notably, mobility issues combined with worsening bone health can lead to a higher incidence of injuries which at old age in particular contribute to all cause mortality.
