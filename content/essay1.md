#The Autotelic Founder

As a founder, building a product should bring you joy. In the past two months, I found myself dealing with two states of mind:
Last month: De-motivated & un-engaged with work
This month: Excited & eager to work

This morning, I was re-listening to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience and it clicked; I was getting closer to a flow state.
“Flow is what describes the feeling of complete involvement with what you are doing. Knowing exactly what you want to do is very important … Activities that make it very clear what you want to do we can call flow activities. Activities created in a way that is structured to produce flow.” Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

I’ve experienced flow in many forms but mostly in sports. I’ve gotten flow or ‘tunnel vision’ when completing in high school basketball games, collegiate track, or pro triathlon races. With work, I’d only experienced it in spurts. This time though, I was experiencing flow in a progressively increasing way. So what was different?

1. Clarity of goal is important
One difference was that I had spent time backward planning with my team and clarified the over-arching goal and the micro-goals to get there. We used a Whimsical flowchart which I update regularly based on updates to either the vision or the short-term goals. This is a parallel step to the weekly sprints that most startups ceremoniously use. In startup life, when the caffeine wears off and you cross the 10th work hour of the day, is when the goal starts getting blurry and abstract philosophical vision ideas (kind of like being high) start taking over. With the flowchart, we all get a chance to step back and see how much we’ve progressed each week. Color-coding what’s currently being worked on, what’s completed and what’s been removed from the goals is a great way to stay visually engaged with the goal. It’s also been a helpful tool when speaking with investors/new team members to quickly get them up to speed and inspire confidence in where we are headed.

2. Know if what you are doing is moving towards that goal
Speaking of sprints, in a startup, making flow activities is extremely important yet extremely hard. It’s easy to feel stressed, unhappy and demotivated over repeating non-flow activities. However, if those activities are:
- Created with an eye towards what will reap the most benefit towards the goal (80:20 rule);
- Well defined in terms of what defines completion;
it’s easier to find a feeling of flow within the daily grind.

Equally important is to integrate a feedback system. If you don’t know what you are doing or how you are doing it’s easy to get distracted, demotivated and removed. Feedback on what you are doing is essential to sustaining flow. This can be accomplished in two ways:
Introduce weekly review loops by more experienced individuals. Within your team, an example could be for a senior developer to review the work of a junior developer. At the founder/C-level, integrate external advisors who have proven experience in delivering results. With such a feedback system, at the end of each week, everyone on the team, top to bottom, has greater confidence what they did was valuable.
Introduce review buddies within your team. After each task is done, assign different team members to review how you completed the task. This many inform them or even create knowledge transfer in terms of how to better execute a similar task in the future. But more critically, this is geared towards creating transparency within the team. Many times, in a startup, the speed of activities makes it hard for everyone on the team to know how something was accomplished. You’re focused on your own work for a week and without knowing, the entire branding has changed. This can be destructive towards experiencing flow as a founder and towards achieving the even higher goal of team flow.

3. Ensure that what you have to do is at the level of your skills.
Tasks should not make you bored or anxious. In other words you are neither taking on a task that overwhelms you nor one that makes you feel you are wasting your time working on. When the job is in the right range of skill and challenge, it leads to both success and excitement in doing the work.

In fact, a consistent flow state leads to levels of both excitement and success with increasingly more complex tasks. If you can get to a point where this is experienced collectively by your team, you’ll be churning out work and progress at an elite level #unicornbound

4. Remove distractions during work
I know, I know … you’ve seen this in EVERY productivity article you’ve ever read (yawn). But just try to imagine flow as your time of escape.
“One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one’s own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought.” Albert Einstein

If you must (and who doesn’t) set aside a specific time in your week (or day) that you only deal with “frustrations.” You’ll probably be even more successful in problem-solving during a structured time, away from work or leisure time.

Why work towards flow as a founder?

There’s no denying that startup life can make you feel like you are in control of nothing — from your work to your relationships and finances, they all seem to be tied to externalities. 

- When you are in a state of flow, you feel like you are more in control of your life. And that’s a huge win in my book.
- When you are in flow, you don’t see yourself as a vulnerable entity and you can stop worrying about societal benchmarks or other comparative standards that plague you.
- Sense of time tends to be transformed. During flow, you get absorbed in the task so much that hours get condensed into minutes and you lose the sense of time.

Individual results may vary. All testimonials are by real people (yours truly), may not reflect the typical founder’s experience, and are not intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results.
