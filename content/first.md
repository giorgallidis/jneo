We've all been there, searching for a new pattern, UI element, or method. You remember seeing it before somewhere but can't quite remember where, or you've got a great idea that you can't quite realize, or you want to try out a new library. When the documentation doesn't live up to the software it's based on, it drags the whole product down.

## Why does poor documentation exist?

There are many reasons we can get documentation that isn't fit for purpose. Project deadlines, developer turnover, or merely leaving documentation until it's too late all lead to poor documentation. On top of this, writing documentation can be hard because developers typically want to be coding, not copywriting. At the same time, documentation is too technical for copywriters to be able to create alone. There are lots of reasons why lousy documentation exists, but it's so critical that there's no excuse good enough not to do it. If you want your software to grow, you have to document it well.
