#The case for continuous temperature monitoring

With rapid advancement in wearable biosensor technology, systems capable of real time, continuous and ambulatory monitoring of vital signs are increasingly emerging and their use can potentially help improve patient outcome. Monitoring continuous body temperature offers insights into its trend, allows early detection of fever and is critical in several diseases and clinical conditions including septicemia, infectious disease and others. There is a complex interaction between physiological and ambient parameters including heart rate, respiratory rate, muscle rigors and shivers, diaphoresis, local humidity, clothing, body, skin and ambient temperatures among others. 

Non-invasive, continuous and real time body temperature monitoring can lead to earlier fever detection and provides remote patient monitoring that can result in improved patient and clinical outcome.

Core temperature is the temperature measured at the deep tissues of the body such as abdominal, thoracic and cranial cavities. The hypothalamus is the controlling center for body temperature regulation, and is fed by heat sensing thermoreceptors in different locations in body including skin, cornea, urinary bladder, liver and hypothalamus. Hypothalamus regulates temperature via. mechanisms such as conduction, convection and radiation mechanisms to maintain temperature typically within a narrow margin normally
between ~36.5-37.5 oC. Continuous body temperature is an important parameter for monitoring potential onset and progression of cardiac arrest, head trauma or stroke, infectious and other non-infectious diseases, where an increase in core temperature is often observed.

Numerous studies have highlighted earlier detection of patient deterioration, lower code blue rates, reduced length of stay, improved patient outcomes and cost effectiveness with continuous non-invasive vital sign monitoring.

Continuous and direct measurement of patient skin temperature is straightforward using thermistor or thermoreceptor elements. Direct skin temperature with added two degrees have also been used as a surrogate of core temperature. However, skin temperature measurement is often contaminated by external sources including ambient temperature, clothing, sun exposure convection of air, etc.

Feasibility study of continuous body temperature-based biosensor highlights the importance of continuous temperature profile in tracking trends, sudden changes and temperature that are not captured by spot check measurements. These temporal changes can have important clinical implications specifically in cases when acute changes in temperature provides early insight into clinical indication.

Several solutions have proposed utilizing heat flux and isothermal pathway method to continuously assess body temperature in perioperative setting. Despite being continuous methods that offer better accuracy than skin temperature with added approximately +2 C, these methods have fundamental limitation of not being ambulatory. Utilizing additional information including physiological, activity based and ambient measurements that have been shown to be correlated to body temperature may provide additional information to further improve the accuracy of body temperature. In addition, the proposed method is a truly an ambulatory solution which has been tested in the presented study in different daily activities indoors and outdoors.

The validation of the evaluated body temperature measurement shows highly accurate, continuous and ambulatory body temperature monitoring that may be utilized for improving patient outcome through early detection of changes in body temperature.
