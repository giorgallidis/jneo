## Do-ism: Process driven planning

![Man sawing](../../images/img_1.jpg)

Time stops for no one. Hours, days, weeks, months, years just tick away. Father time is unbeaten as the saying goes. Along with it possibly go your hopes, dreams and ambitions. As far as terrifying thoughts go, the thought of wasting the limited time I have on this earth is one of the most terrifying for me. The thought of wasted time is paralyzing.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.‚Äù and ‚ÄúThere is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.‚Äù
‚Äï Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist
For the dreamer in me, reading that lights a fire inside of me and pushes me on days when I don‚Äôt feel like it. But the cynic in me questions the absurdity of feel-good quotes. Having gone through my fair share of ups and downs in the struggle to meet high intrinsic expectations hampered by a variety of externalities, I needed more than just nice words. Through that ongoing internal negotiation, a process emerged to combat the cognitive dissonance.
Over the past 2 years, I‚Äôve experimented with a number of different productivity models (like GTD and more), and listened to the advice of several people who had something to say on the subject of healthy achievement-oriented thinking (like Naval Ravikant, and many others). I found those ideas to work in part, but in my case it always seemed to leave me looking for more. So I built my own version of what I call a wellness system to accomplish what I had in my mind.
Step 1: The Goal/Dream
Yes ‚Äî it always starts here. You need to know where you want to end up so you can determine the best path to get there. This is highly individual and not something you want to pick from someone else‚Äôs path or be given by someone else.
It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt know what this is yet. But come up with a way to discover what you‚Äôre going after sooner than later. Some people never discover it and it leads to a life of regret. Invest some purposeful, structured time to discover what you‚Äôre working towards.
Step 2: Plan Backwards
Image for post
Once the dream/goal is there, now you need to ask, what has to happen for me to reach the promised land? This is the time to be brutally honest. Put it all in a document. I use a mix of a Google Sheets template and a visual mind map (I like Whimsical). Take your time with this. I‚Äôve put together a Google Sheets template for you to get a general idea of what the objective is here.
I can‚Äôt stress how important this is to be done right. Research, ask experts, think it over and then when you‚Äôre done think it some more until you have an exhaustive detail of the steps it will take to reach the goal. This will inform what you‚Äôll do with your productive time for the foreseeable future.
It will also help remove the mystique of the unknown hidden in your biggest dreams that will feed your with fear when the going gets tough. It will help you quantify the time and resources it will take to succeed.
Step 3: Micro-Plan
Now that you know the pillars of what needs to happen to meet that dream, we‚Äôre ready to step into the micro planning. This informs the day-to-day, week-by-week and month-by-month activities you need to do to reach that dream/goal. In order to be able to best approximate my goal timelines (and avoid unwarranted stress), I track everything I do in a day/week including meals, exercise, work, learning, chores, sleep etc. to see how much time I actually have in a day for achievement oriented activities and not lie to myself.
Here‚Äôs what that looks like:
Deep Work: Pomodoro based splits across my tasks for the day.
Health Needs
Meals (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner)
Hygiene (e.g. shower, cleanups)
Exercise (e.g. going for a run, gym)
Mind (e.g. meditation, neurofeedback, reading)
Medicals (e.g. physical therapy, blood work)
Social (e.g. in person time with family & friends, calls with family & friends)
3. Growth
Learning & personal development (e.g languages, engineering etc)
Personal branding (e.g. content creation, social media posting, etc.)
4. Chores (we all know what this is üòí)
5. Distractions (e.g. playing games, watching TV)
You‚Äôre probably thinking the above is excessive. Why bother with measuring things like showering, cleanups, eating meals etc when those things have to be done by everyone? I‚Äôll explain more below.
Step 4: Quantify
Simply tracking these activities as binary yes/no check marks doesn‚Äôt do much. You need a feedback system to know if you‚Äôre moving closer towards or further away from your goal. There‚Äôs 24 hours in a day and assuming you‚Äôre not following some bespoke time frame (I do that some times) you‚Äôll likely need to fit your activities into those 24 hours. 30 minutes is 30 minutes any which way you cut it. But not every 30 minute activity is made equal. For example 30 minutes of watching a Netflix show is not similar to 30 mins doing Deep Work. The Deep Work concept was coined by Cal Newport, a renowned author and computer science professor at Georgetown University, in a 2012 blog post and expanded upon in his 2016 bestselling book, Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World. By Newport‚Äôs definition, deep work refers to:
‚ÄúProfessional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.‚Äù
So I created a point system to guide me through how to organize my daily activities to meet my goals. Let‚Äôs look at some examples of 30 minute activities and their different possible value (out of 10):
Deep work: +10 / Skipped -5
Health activity: +6 / Skipped ‚Äî 5
Growth activity: +8 / Skipped -3
Chore: +1 / Skipped 0
Distraction: -1 / Skipped 0
Goal activities are assigned different points based on their ‚Äòvalue‚Äô and a penalty is assessed if they are skipped. I see it as more of an exercise in compound returns. The penalty system isn‚Äôt there so that you can be ‚Äòpunished‚Äô. It‚Äôs about:
1. integrating maximum productivity vs. just being busy
2. productivity with the biggest returns vs similar effort tasks with less returns
3. maximizing the benefits of compound habits (reinforcing positives and penalizing negatives).
The actual points for each type of activity can be based of a general subjective feeling (e.g. a 1‚Äì10 scale as in the example above) or something more specific based off of the value you want to generate per hour.
Let‚Äôs say you wanted to make $100,000 in the next 6 months. There are 26.0715 weeks in 6 months (let‚Äôs call it 26 weeks). If we assume that you can deliver 40 productive work hours a week that means you need to solve for X to figure out the economic value each hour must produce. X = 100,000 / (40).(26)
Another key goal of the system is to minimize the feeling of lack of accomplishment. By gamifying the tasks with a point or value system, if you did a good job at assigning these points and value at the beginning, then you‚Äôll be able to objectively know if you‚Äôre accomplishing enough. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt get the points right from the get-go. Treat this very much as an agile approach. Keep optimizing and improving.
It will be easier to keep track of these tasks with a productivity / to-do tool. I use Todoist and below I‚Äôll give you a step-by-step on how to set these tasks up in Todoist (I assume this should be translatable to other productivity tools fairly easy):
Step 5: Implement
Put EVERYTHING you do each day on Todoist. That includes things like we discussed above (having lunch, showers, washing your face, shaving etc.) In a productivity tool, this also allows you to optimize all those repetitive tasks to be more efficient by either reducing the time each takes or by grouping them together so they are less distracting.
Categorize all your tasks by whatever categories seem relevant to you (you can always start with the ones I provided above) in the form of Projects. For example, Deep work, Health, Growth are different projects. Further categorize deep work activities into Projects if you have more than one Project. Any task that isn‚Äôt definable just yet should go into the inbox. Examples of this would be ideas that you‚Äôve just had that you don‚Äôt yet know what it will take to properly execute them.
Assign labels to each task by the time you think it will take. You can create labels for 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour etc tasks. You‚Äôll likely over-estimate your capability to complete tasks several times in the beginning but that‚Äôs the point. To learn what takes how long and optimize. When you‚Äôve done this correctly, and armed with the knowledge of what is a more valuable task, you‚Äôll be able to plan your tasks for the day based on what can realistically be accomplished in that day and based on what will create the most value within 24 hours.
Use subtasks, for big tasks. For example, writing an article on X topic, doesn‚Äôt involve just writing. It also includes the research, first draft, second draft, final draft, final editing for example.
Create as many repetitive tasks as possible by specifying ‚Äòdaily‚Äô in the deadline. Here are examples of repetitive tasks:
Shower
Workout
Meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
Cleanups (morning, night)
Other tips:
Write everything you did the previous week that wasn‚Äôt part of your positive categories or that could be delegatable. For example, major sources of distractions, a type of chore activity(ies), work that was tedious but could have been done by someone else at a low per hour cost (or lower than the value you have assigned to your productive hours).
Use Todoist‚Äôs prioritization labels and/or schedule a time for when something is due so that it jumps to the top of the daily list
Sync Todoist with your calendar. This will save you time from having to double input a task.
Integrate Todoist with other tools as you see fit that will add tasks automatically as needed or get tasks handled without further action by you. For example, you can integrate Fancy Hands through Zapier and create special labels and projects that automatically assign those tasks. Or you could integrate your tasks from our project management tools both ways.
Parting Thoughts
I‚Äôm weary of the above system being considered a productivity system. It‚Äôs not ‚Äî it‚Äôs much more than that. It‚Äôs a health system. Why? It allows you to structure your activities around your goals: emotional, financial, physical and otherwise. It conditions you to do the right activities and it keeps you honest with yourself. It‚Äôs geared towards reducing nervous breakdowns.
‚ÄúPeople are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.‚Äù
‚Äï Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist
