## Longevity Variable: Dietary Restriction 
---

## **TL;DR**

Caloric restriction(CR) without malnutrition is the most effective non-pharmacological intervention that enhances longevity and healthspan in numerous nonhuman species. Dietary restriction (DR), implemented as chronic and coordinate reduced intake of all dietary constituents except vitamins and minerals, without malnutrition results in many of the same physiological, metabolic, and molecular changes associated with DR in animals, including less age-associated myocardial stiffness and autonomic dysfunction, lower core body temperature, and downregulation of the pi3k/akt/ foxo and inflammatory pathways in skeletal muscle. In short-term, randomized clinical trials in aging humans, DR improves several markers of health. 

### Key Points:

1. Caloric restriction (CR) without malnutrition is the most effective non-pharmacological intervention that enhances longevity and healthspan in numerous nonhuman species (Weindruch, 1996). Calorie restriction (CR) is a potent modulator of longevity in multiple species. Caloric restriction (defined as fasting and taking less calories than total daily energy needs) has been proven to reduce oxidative stress through various pathways. A growing body of evidence shows that sustained periods of CR without malnutrition improves risk factors involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders in humans. Innovative dietary strategies such as intermittent fasting and protein restriction have recently emerged as alternative approaches that improve markers of aging. CR was shown to suppress the age-related and oxidative stress-related diseases of cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases. It also inhibited inflammation and reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). The TOR signaling pathway is another nutrient sensor that is suppressed by CR. TOR suppression under nutrient starvation conditions enhanced autophagy, which removes damaged mitochondria, a major source of ROS production, and preserves their function.
2. On balance, CALERIE phase 2 displayed that sustained modest CR in young healthy individuals without obesity is feasible, can improve mechanistic markers linked to primary and secondary aging, and does not compromise general well-being. Such conclusions are boosted because of the control group, the increased duration of the intervention, the extensive collection of endpoints, and the greater objectivity of adherence measures relative to other human aging studies. These strengths qualify the CALERIE phase 2 trial as the current benchmark nutritional intervention to which other human studies assessing dietary strategies and age-related processes can be evaluated.
3. However, the challenge remains in the difficulty to sustain CR long term. Instead, a modified system of intermittent fasting, nutrient restriction (such as avoiding methiodine and other nutrients associated with increased activation of mTOR and other oxidative stress stimulants) and nutrient supplementation that achieve the same effect (e.g. Resveratrol) might be more sustainable and achieve the same results (but more research is needed). Although the beneficial effects of CR on health promotion have been confirmed in humans, strict long-term CR is very hard to accomplish. Hence, alternative approaches that mimic the beneficial effects of CR are desired. A modified CR protocol, such as intermittent fasting, the restriction of specified nutrient components, and pharmacological supplementation (to be presented in a later analysis), has been proposed.
4. Dietary Restriction (DR) has been shown to carry many if not all of the same benefits of Caloric Restriction. Dietary restriction (DR), implemented as chronic and coordinate reduced intake of all dietary constituents except vitamins and minerals, was first shown 80 years ago to extend lifespan in rats. DR in both rats and mice improves most aspects of health during aging (Fontana et al., 2010a; Ikeno et al., 2006; Maeda et al., 1985).  DR can produce substantial benefits with, for instance, 30% of DR animals dying at old ages without gross pathological lesions, compared with only 6% of ad-libitum-fed controls (Ikeno et al., 2006). DR started in young, adult Rhesus monkeys greatly improves metabolic health; prevents obesity; delays the onset of sarcopenia, presbycusis, and brain atrophy; and reduces the risk of developing and dying of type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (Colman et al., 2014; Mattison et al., 2012). In humans, severe food restriction without malnutrition results in many of the same physiological, metabolic, and molecular changes associated with DR in animals, including less age-associated myocardial stiffness and autonomic dysfunction, lower core body temperature, and downregulation of the pi3k/akt/ foxo and inflammatory pathways in skeletal muscle (Cava and Fontana, 2013; Mercken et al., 2013). Furthermore, humans voluntarily undertaking long-term DR score lower than controls on multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer (Fontana et al., 2010b). In short-term, randomized clinical trials in aging humans, DR improves several markers of health (Heilbronn et al., 2006; Fontana et al., 2010b).
5. Molecular effectors that have been shown to mediate the effects of DR on health and longevity include **FOXO** (Tullet et al., 2008; Webb and Brunet, 2014), TOR (Kapahi et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2013), **AMPK** (Greer et al., 2007; Burkewitz et al., 2014), **sirtuins** (Mouchiroud et al., 2013; Guarente, 2013), **HSF, and NRF2** (Akerfelt et al., 2010; Martı´n-Montalvo et al., 2011). The impact can be observed in enhanced DNA repair, increased autophagy, increased antioxidant activity, better stress resistance, improved cell proliferation, improved proteostasis, enhanced stem cell function, increased genomic stability, improved metabolic homeostasis (Mouchiroud et al., 2013; Guarente, 2013) mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation (Wu et al., 1999). 
6. Beyond caloric (amount of calories) or dietary (type of nutrients) restrictions, recent findings also indicate that meal timing is crucial, with both intermittent fasting (IF) and adjusted diurnal rhythm of feeding improving health and function, in the absence of changes in overall intake. Various forms of IF have been proposed, but generally they involve the severe or complete restriction of energy intake for periods of 12 h or more.  These prolonged periods of energy restriction are posited to elevate the metabolism of endogenous substrates, such as ketones, non-esterified fatty acids, and glycerol, and in turn stimulate adaptive processes that improve body composition and physiological function (Anton et al., 2018). At a cellular level, the improvements in physiological functioning seem to be mediated through a series of integrated signalling pathways that lower inflammation and oxidative stress and ultimately improve health and disease resistance.

### Problematic amino-acids in animal and dairy:

### **The Five Stages of Intermittent (and Prolonged) Fasting**

**By 12 hours, you’ve entered the metabolic state called ketosis ([Anton et al., Obesity 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5783752/)). In this state, your body starts to break down and burn fat.**

Some of this fat is used by the liver to produce ketone bodies. Ketone bodies, or ketones, serve as an alternative energy source for the cells of your heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, when glucose isn’t readily available. Did you know that [your brain uses up some 60% of your glucose when your body is in the resting state](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22436/)? When you are fasting, ketone bodies generated by your liver partly replace glucose as fuel for your brain as well as other organs. This ketone usage by your brain is one of the reasons that fasting is often claimed to promote mental clarity and positive mood – ketones produce less inflammatory products as they are being metabolized than does glucose, and they can even kick-start production of the brain growth factor **BDNF**! [Ketones have also been shown to reduce cellular damage and cell death in neurons and can also reduce inflammation in other cell types](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32192146).

**By 18 hours, you’ve switched to fat-burning mode and are generating significant ketones ([Anton et al., Obesity 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5783752/)).** You can now begin to measure blood ketone levels above your baseline values. Under normal conditions, [the concentration of ketones in your plasma ranges between 0.05 and 0.1 mM. When you fast or restrict the carbohydrates in your diet, this concentration can reach 5-7 mM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32192146).

As their level in your bloodstream rises, ketones can act as signaling molecules, similar to hormones, to tell your body to ramp up stress-busting pathways that reduce inflammation and repair damaged DNA for example.

**Within 24 hours, your cells are increasingly recycling old components and breaking down misfolded proteins linked to Alzheimer’s and other diseases ([Alirezaei et al., Autophagy 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/auto.6.6.12376)). This is a process called autophagy.**

Autophagy is an important process for cellular and tissue rejuvenation – it removes damaged cellular components including misfolded proteins. When your cells can’t or don’t initiate autophagy, bad things happen, [including neurodegenerative diseases](https://medium.com/lifeomic/time-restricted-feeding-clears-mutant-huntingtin-protein-from-the-brains-of-mice-c02fc92c2141), which seem to come about as a result of the [reduced autophagy that occurs during aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30172870). Fasting activates the AMPK signaling pathway and inhibits mTOR activity, which in turn activates autophagy. This only begins to happen, however, when you substantially deplete your glucose stores and your insulin levels begin to drop. [In mice deprived of food, autophagy increases after 24 hours and this effect is magnified in cells of the liver and brain after 48 hours.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30172870) In humans, autophagy has been [detected in neutrophils starting at 24 hours of fasting](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15548627.2016.1271513). [Exercise together with caloric restriction through fasting can also increase autophagy in many body tissues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30430746).

**By 48 hours without calories or with very few calories, carbs or protein, your growth hormone level is up to five times as high as when you started your fast ([Hartman et al.,1992](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/74/4/757/3004645?redirectedFrom=fulltext)).**

Part of the reason for this is that ketone bodies produced during fasting promote growth hormone secretion, for example in the brain. [Ghrelin, the hunger hormone, also promotes growth hormone secretion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016648008004000). Growth hormone helps preserve lean muscle mass and reduces fat tissue accumulation, [particularly as we age](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199007053230101). It also appears to play a role in [mammalian longevity](https://academic.oup.com/edrv/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1210/er.2018-00216/5253327) and can promote [wound healing and cardiovascular health](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/1/290).

**By 54 hours, your insulin has dropped to its lowest level point since you started fasting and your body is becoming increasingly insulin-sensitive ([Klein et al., 1993](https://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpendo.1993.265.5.E801)).**

[Lowering your insulin levels has a range of health benefits](https://lifeapps.io/fasting/what-to-expect-on-a-5-day-prolonged-fast/) both short term and long term. Lowered insulin levels put a brake on the insulin and mTOR signaling pathways, activating autophagy. Lowered insulin levels can reduce inflammation, make you more insulin sensitive (and/or less [insulin resistant](https://lifeapps.io/fasting/haunted-by-sugar-how-to-beat-insulin-resistance/), which is especially a good thing if you have a high risk of developing diabetes) and protect you from chronic diseases of aging including [cancer](https://lifeapps.io/nutrition/new-connections-between-cancer-and-insulin-resistance/).

**By 72 hours, your body is breaking down old immune cells and generating new ones ([Cheng et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905167)).**

Prolonged fasting reduces circulating IGF-1 levels and PKA activity in various cell populations. IGF-1, or insulin-like growth factor 1, looks a lot like insulin and has growth-promoting effects on almost every cell in the body. IGF-1 activates signaling pathways including the PI3K-Akt pathway that promotes cell survival and growth. PKA can also activate the mTOR pathway (and, of interest, too much caffeine during a fast may promote activation of PKA).

You might see where this is leading – pressing the brakes on IGF-1 and PKA through nutrient restriction and fasting can turn down cellular survival pathways and lead to breakdown and recycling of old cells and proteins. Studies in mice have shown that prolonged fasting (greater than 48 hours), by reducing IGF-1 and PKA, leads to [stress resistance, self-renewal and regeneration of hematopoietic or blood cell stem cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905167). Through this same mechanism, prolonged fasting for 72 hours has been shown to [preserve healthy white blood cell or lymphocyte counts in patients undergoing chemotherapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905167).

### Fasting Hack: Exercise!

Doing light to moderate resistance activity during your prolonged fast can help to preserve muscle mass while helping your body to burn fats for fuel. Exercise will also further promote ketone production and autophagy, and may help you feel energized through the tougher periods of your fasting. Consider going for swimming, or doing some strengthening or yoga.

### **Bonus stage: Refeeding!!**

The last and perhaps most important stage of fasting is the refeeding stage. From [Mark Mattson and colleagues at the National Institute on Aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5913738/): “Upon refeeding, ingested carbohydrates* and glucose stimulate release into the blood of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) from enteroendocrine cells in the gut. GLP1 enhances clearance of glucose from the blood by stimulating insulin release from the pancreas and increases the insulin sensitivity of cells. GLP1 crosses the blood–brain barrier and can act directly on neurons to promote synaptic plasticity, enhance cognition and bolster cellular stress resistance.” It’s important to break your fast with a nutritious, balanced meal that will further improve the function of cells and tissues that went through cleanup while you were fasting.  The meal should include plenty of vegetables, plant fibers and plant fats, with healthy proteins and some whole grains or legumes if you choose. Avoid simple sugars and processed/packaged foods. 

### Some additional considerations:

**Hunger**: 

Hunger as you would expect is an important topic in any type of fast. You will feel hungry, especially at first. These hunger sensations may also be heightened for women, who have been [reported to have higher fasting levels of ghrelin](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/81/1/69/4607679) (the hunger hormone). This hunger hormone is largely responsible for the coming and going of those stomach groans we call hunger. [Ghrelin is produced primarily by the stomach and increases appetite and food intake](https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/ghrelin/#:~:text=Ghrelin%20is%20a%20hormone%20that,intake%20and%20promotes%20fat%20storage.). How you experience hunger will likely be specific to you. It will depend largely on your mental relationship to that rise and fall of the hunger hormones. If managed correctly, you'll notice that yes you'll be hungry but you may not react to it as much as you think. [Hunger also follows the circardian rhythm closely.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3655529/) Ghrelin levels rise throughout the day, hitting a peak in early to late afternoon and slowly decrease as you prepare for sleep. But you'll be happy to know that [ghrelin levels also slowly decrease over a multi-day fast.](https://thefastingmethod.com/fasting-ghrelin-fasting-29/) This is why, if you fast for 2-5 days, you'll probably find the first few days are the most difficult while both your hunger sensations decrease and your mental model adapts to not responding to hunger. 

Interestingly the desire to eat can also be triggered by specific smells (i.e. food craving) and these [food cues activate the brain reward system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5341214/). This happens especially when we are hungry and your brain is triggered to search for calorie dense foods. In addition, your second brain - your gut, also prepares for eating by producing more stomach acid to break down food (something that can become troublesome during a prolonged fast as the acid has no way to go but up). It's advisable that you avoid environments that have the potential to induce food cravings.

**Glucose and insulin:**

You’ll likely find that your fasting blood glucose levels drop over time throughout a prolonged fast, as do your insulin levels. Lowering your blood glucose and insulin levels is good for a variety of reasons. Chronically high blood glucose and insulin put you at risk for diabetes and heart disease. These molecules also tell your cells that “times are good” and signal them to grow while bypassing cellular recycling and protein cleanup processes that help prevent diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.

"[Reduced fasting insulin has also been associated with increased longevity in humans](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/297/5582/811.long).” – [Heilbronn et al., 2005](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/81/1/69/4607679)

[Observational studies of prolonged fasting](https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpendo.1993.265.5.E801) have found that fasting glucose levels typically begin to lower significantly between 24 and 36 hours into a fast, reaching a stable lowered level around 50 hours.

Insulin levels drop to nearly as low as they will reach by the time you are 50+ hours into your prolonged fast, being cut nearly in half as compared to what you started with. But much of this drop happens quickly, even within the first 24 hours. So in case you decide to cut your multi-day fast short, you’ll still have significantly lowered your insulin levels and prompted your body’s cells to begin to pause their “grow and divide” programs and to recycle their components.

“In preclinical studies, cyclic calorie-restricted diets reduce the risk of several cancers and improve the antitumor activity of standard treatments against already established malignancies. In particular, the fasting mimicking diet (FMD), […] repeated cyclically every 3-4 weeks, enhances the antitumor activity of cytotoxic chemotherapy, while contemporarily protecting healthy tissues and stimulating antitumor immunity. Most of these effects are likely mediated by the reduction of blood glycemia and growth factors, such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). When administered to healthy volunteers, cyclic FMD has been shown to be safe and capable of reducing risk factors for different chronic diseases.” – Fasting-mimicking Diet in Patients Undergoing Active Cancer Treatment, Clinical Trial.

If you do have any blood sugar regulation issues or if you take medications to regulate your blood sugar, you shouldn’t practice prolonged fasting without consulting your physician, as your medication levels will need to change over the course of the fast.

**Ketones:**

As you progress beyond 16 hours of fasting, if you measure your blood or breath ketone levels (for example with the [Keto-Mojo blood ketone meter](https://lifeapps.io/ia/measure-glucose/) or [BIOSENSE](https://lifeapps.io/ia/breath-ketone-measurement/)) you’ll notice that these start to slowly rise above baseline. Your ketone levels will also jump up each progressive morning of a multi-day fast. Rising ketone levels are a signal that your body is burning fat for fuel and using fatty acids to produce ketones in your liver.

Ketones serve as a highly efficient alternative energy source for your brain and other organs. But they also have a range of other benefits when present in high numbers in your bloodstream. Groundbreaking research has revealed that ketones serve as signaling molecules, like hormones, that can initiate cellular processes and even change gene expression to make you more resilient to stress. For example, [ketones may activate genes that help in fat metabolism and also protect your DNA from damage](https://lifeapps.io/fasting/ketones-may-activate-stress-busting-genes-in-the-brain/). A cycling ketogenic diet, or a regular cycle of high ketone levels, has been found to improve healthy lifespan and memory in aging mice, based on research by John Newman at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. [Research](https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(18)30605-1) also suggests that ketone molecules including beta-hydroxybutyrate protect the cardiovascular system from the impacts of [cellular senescence](https://lifeapps.io/uncategorized/senolytics-exercise-and-fasting-fight-off-senescent-cells/) that occurs with aging.

**Fatigue**

You may experience some fatigue and feelings of weakness, lightheadedness, slowness or lack of motivation throughout a prolonged fast, especially in the first few days. Fatigue in particular is normal as your body adapts to this period of low calorie intake. Fatigue may occur as your body is transitioning from burning readily available sugars to mobilizing and burning fats; you may even go through “carbohydrate withdrawal” in a sense.

These symptoms can be signs of low blood sugar or [hypoglycemia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685), a condition that can affect you while fasting particularly if you are accustomed to frequently consuming added sugars, have [insulin resistance](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance) or liver issues such as fatty liver. While you can improve insulin resistance and hypoglycemia over time by practicing intermittent fasting, you may need to consult your physician and ease into prolonged fasting if you do experience [a range of hypoglycemia symptoms while fasting](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685).

In the absence of diabetes, a condition for which you will need to work with your physician, you can work on your blood sugar regulation to prevent [hypoglycemia](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-problems/low-blood-glucose-hypoglycemia) during prolonged fasts by engaging in regular physical activity, increasing your intake of dietary fibers and vegetables, reducing your intake of added sugars and simple carbohydrates, and easing your way into fasting by reducing snacking in between meals and practicing overnight fasting for 12 or more hours. A healthy liver and insulin sensitivity are important components of being able to regulate your blood sugar levels during a prolonged fast.

If you are only experiencing slight fatigue and side effects of low blood sugar while fasting, you might find that drinking a cup of coffee in the morning helps you to feel much better. We definitely did throughout our Prolon fast at LifeOmic! Coffee not only contains caffeine that can help counteract fatigue, but [regular coffee consumption appears to be related to improved insulin sensitivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16477539https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16477539). Plant compounds in coffee, including [polyphenols and chlorogenic acids, act to reduce inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity by activating AMPK](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2225411018300014). (However, if you already have impaired blood sugar control for any reason, [caffeine can acutely make this worse](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/expert-answers/blood-sugar/faq-20057941). Also in an update from the Prolon team, you may want to avoid more than one cup of coffee per day on a fast as [caffeine may activate PKA](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/caffeine#section=Top), a [protein that is reduced by prolonged fasting](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4102383/).)

You might find that you sleep really well while practicing prolonged fasting (although the opposite can be true if you experience symptoms of low blood sugar). Healthy amounts of sleep will help give you energy and better regulate your blood sugar while on a prolonged fast. Therefore, be mindful of behaviors that could disturb your sleep while you are fasting, such as consuming caffeinated teas at night.

## N of 1: Experimenting with a 5-day water fast

Going through a 5-day water fast wasn't as bad as I would have expected and I definitely identified some benefits. First few days post fast the adipose fat loss was the main thing but looking beyond that, not sure how much of this can be attributed to fasting, but I'm able to focus a bit better, motivation is a bit higher, frustration lower and some psychosomatic symptoms I was experiencing seem to be gone. 

You need to know you're healthy before undergoing a 5-day water fast. My lipids went through the roof and I'm generally very healthy along those lines. And it's much better if you've been fasting intermittently before this. I had regularly fasted along a 16:8 or 18:6 schedule for approximately 2 years and experienced 20+ hour fasts several times. 

I will try a 5-day FMD diet (~700 keto diet) next quarter. Nutritional modulation of the microbiome can also be important, and there are long-term, including inter-generational, effects of diet but I'll cover these in the microbiome specific analysis. 

### **Weight:**

178.5 (81kg) to 166.2 (75.4kg). -12.3lbs(-5.6kg) 

Lost my water weight the first 2 days ~8lbs/3.6kgs (make a line graph with this and pinpoint the stages). Next 3 days lost fat (cite sources). Total lost about 4.3lbs/1.95kgs. 

[Blood work before, on day 5 and 1 week after](https://www.notion.so/1c5b7b065dbd44c0ba60b574849f766c)

Fast break meal:

By the end of a 5-day fast, your stomach has shrunk. You've also just spent 5 days restoring your body's cells and gut bacteria. You should have two key goals: Don't over eat and eat as high quality of food as possible. In my case, I chose to break my fast as follows:

1. One slice of watermelon; waited for 5 minutes to see how my stomach would react. 
2. A spinach, avocado, macadamia nut and EVOO; waited another 15-minutes again.
3. A one egg omelet with tomato, ham, hard cheese, and turmeric cooked in EVOO and capped it with a small piece of organic 70% dark chocolate. 

In all about 750 calories. I chose only fresh, organic ingredients. 

Since this meal was ketogenic (15-70-15) I was able to break my water fast but extend my ketogenic state for another half day until my next day meal. 

## Ongoing application

From a dietary restriction standpoint, these are the interventions I plan on testing out and collecting data for the next 6 months (through March 2021):

1. IF for 18:6 and work up to 20:4 during week days. Min 12 hours during weekends but aim for 16:8. 
2. Fasting starts at 7:30-8pm and ends at 3:30-4pm. 
3. Re-feeding to coincide with end of exercise to direct food to muscle repair vs. storage. 
4. Limit animal proteins (meat, fish, dairy) to only post-exercise in order to limit intake of the problematic types of amino acids.
5. Once a quarter, undertake a longer (5-day) fast with the fast-mimicking diet protocol (<400 calories per day).
